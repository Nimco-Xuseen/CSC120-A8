Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
The GTACharacter class represents a character in a GTA-style game, capable of performing actions like grabbing and dropping items, walking and flying, and managing health and stamina. The class implements various methods defined in the Contract interface, such as grab(), drop(), use(), walk(), and others, which simulate typical in-game interactions.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
In addition to the methods in the interface, no additional methods were implemented outside of the required ones. The class manages an inventory system and character stats like health and stamina, which are based on actions like using items or walking.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The simulation functions as expected, with the character successfully interacting with items, moving around, and adjusting stats like health and stamina. All methods in the interface were properly implemented.One challenge faced was ensuring that each method properly interacted with the character's inventory and stats without causing issues or side effects. For future students, itâ€™s important to focus on managing object state (like health or stamina) and to test each method thoroughly to ensure consistency across interactions.
